# Airline Service Dashboard

This project involves an open source data retrieved from Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/sjleshrac/airlines-customer-satisfaction. The dataset contains customers' feedbacks with regards to the services provided by Invistico Airlines. Using Tableau, customer satisfaction analysis for the airline company is performed.

The overall customers' ratings are presented along with the breakdowns of ratings for in-flight and pre/post flight services.

Then, the customers' profiles are demonstrated in terms of age, gender, loyalty, travel type and class of flights. These profiles are further broken down based on the customers' satisfaction. The darker shade represents satisfied customers, while the lighter shade reflects non-satisfied customers.

Finally, the overall flight distances travelled are reviewed. A drop-down menu is displayed in this section to allow selection of customers' profile parameters. By selecting the desired parameter, the distribution of flight distance is compared against the customers' details.
